# Application - Magic: The Gathering EDH (Commander) play group stats tracker

## Main problem
Magic: the Gathering EDH (Commander) play groups often want to track their play group statistics and do so using spreadsheets or pen and paper, or they don't do it at all, missing out on insights or the social aspect of statistics tracking. This application would provide those players with a way to track the games they played.

## Minimum set of features
- Users can create play groups and invite other users to join them. Users must be able to browse their playgroups.
- Users can add games to a play group. The games history of a play group can later be browsed.
- A dashboard that summarizes a playgroup's statistics.
- Scryfall integration

## What is NOT included in the MVP
- Individual user pages/profiles
- Individual commander pages or insights
- Intricate permission system - all players in a play group can perform all the actions available
- Past data import

## Success criteria
- 90% of the users have created or joined at least 1 playgroup
- 80% of the users have recorded at least 1 game
- 25% of the playgroups have at least 2 active users
